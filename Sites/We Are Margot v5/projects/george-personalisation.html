            <h1>Bringing personalisation to the George website</h1>
            <div>
                <p>George is one of ASDAs flagship brands, selling fashion, homeware and baby products.</p>
                <p>We Are Margot were asked by George to help understand how they could improve their customersâ€™ experience through personalisation.</p>
                <p>We planned and ran a discovery research with George customers and teams including usability testing, prototype design and design and ideation workshops.</p>
                <p>Our research helped the George team develop a number of propositions that help customers discover, re-find and reorder products.</p>
