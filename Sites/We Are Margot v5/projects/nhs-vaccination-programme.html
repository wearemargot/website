            <h1>Improving the NHS Coronavirus Vaccination Programme</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The NHS vaccination programme has been credited as one of the most successful in rolling out vaccines during the Coronavirus pandemic. In a short space of time, the NHS put jabs in millions of peopleâ€™s arms to help protect the nation.</p>
                <p>We were asked to carry out research with GPs, pharmacists and others involved in the vaccination programme to understand the successes of its roll out, and the challenges faced involving digital services.</p>
                <p>We conducted interviews and observations with vaccination staff, discovering their challenges and user needs. Our findings enabled us to make recommendations for the incremental improvement, and future development of new digital services to support the ongoing vaccination programme.</p>
