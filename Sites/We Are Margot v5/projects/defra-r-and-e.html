            <h1>Improving access to regulations and guidance for farmers</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>Under the government's <em>Future Farming Programme</em>, Defra are overhauling the way that farmers receive payments and grants.</p>
                    <p>We Are Margot led a discovery to help Defra understand how farmers currently access regulations and rules that govern rural payments.</p>
                    <p>We ran research sessions with diverse range of farmers across England, including those who are hard to reach and who have low digital literacy.</p>
                    <p>Our research saw us uncover farmersâ€™ needs, understand the challenges of accessing information in a farming environment and make recommendations for how a better service could be designed.</p>
