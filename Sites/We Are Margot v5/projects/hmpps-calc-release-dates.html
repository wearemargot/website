            <h1>Making it easier to calculate release dates in prisons</h1>
            <div>
                <p>We Are Margot are currently working with HM Prison and Probate Service to improve usability and efficiency of release date calculations, helping replace legacy systems.</p>
                <p>We are applying our interaction design expertise to design and prototype the new Calculate release dates service. Working closely with the team, we have designed and developed working prototypes that have been tested with users working on offender management units during the alpha and beta phases of the project.</p>
