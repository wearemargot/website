            <h2>Making the NHS website better for everyone</h2>
            <p>The NHS website provides health information to over 50 million visitors a month.</p>
            <p>We helped transform and redesign the website to deliver high quality health information when people need it, in a way thatâ€™s accessible and works for all.</p>
            <p>We Are Margot supported the redesign of NHS.UK by leading user research, carrying out usability studies, tree tests, card sorts and surveys with over 60,000 people. We spoke to over 80 members of the public in one to one sessions, including over 40 users with disabilities or access needs.</p>
